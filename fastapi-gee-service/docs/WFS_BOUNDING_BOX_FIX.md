# WFS Bounding Box Fix

## Problem

MapStore was throwing a JavaScript error:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'ows:LowerCorner')
```

This error occurred when MapStore tried to parse WFS capabilities XML that was missing proper bounding box information.

## Root Cause

The WFS GetCapabilities response was missing proper `ows:BoundingBox` elements with `ows:LowerCorner` and `ows:UpperCorner` child elements that MapStore expects.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced WFS Capabilities Generation

Updated the WFS GetCapabilities response to include both:
- `ows:WGS84BoundingBox` (standard WFS format)
- `ows:BoundingBox` with `crs="EPSG:4326"` (MapStore compatible format)

### 2. Proper Bounding Box Structure

Each FeatureType now includes:
```xml
<ows:WGS84BoundingBox>
    <ows:LowerCorner>110.426 -1.829</ows:LowerCorner>
    <ows:UpperCorner>110.498 -1.781</ows:UpperCorner>
</ows:WGS84BoundingBox>
<ows:BoundingBox crs="EPSG:4326">
    <ows:LowerCorner>110.426 -1.829</ows:LowerCorner>
    <ows:UpperCorner>110.498 -1.781</ows:UpperCorner>
</ows:BoundingBox>
```

### 3. Error Handling

Added comprehensive error handling:
- If FeatureCollection statistics fail, provide default global bounding box
- If bounding box data is missing, provide fallback coordinates
- Ensure all FeatureType elements have proper bounding box information

## Files Modified

1. **`fastapi-gee-service/main.py`**
   - Updated `wfs_get_capabilities()` function
   - Enhanced bounding box XML generation
   - Added error handling for missing bbox data

2. **`fastapi-gee-service/gee_integration.py`**
   - Enhanced CSW records bounding box handling
   - Added validation for bounding box data structure

## Testing

Use the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_wfs_fix.py
```

The test checks:
- WFS GetCapabilities returns proper XML
- Bounding box elements are present and properly formatted
- WFS GetFeature returns valid GeoJSON
- Feature structure is correct

## Expected Results

After the fix:
1. MapStore should no longer throw the `ows:LowerCorner` error
2. WFS capabilities should display properly in MapStore
3. FeatureCollections should be discoverable via WFS
4. Bounding boxes should be correctly parsed by MapStore

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check WFS GetCapabilities:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8001/wfs?service=WFS&version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities"
   ```

2. **Look for bounding box elements:**
   - Should contain `<ows:WGS84BoundingBox>` elements
   - Should contain `<ows:BoundingBox crs="EPSG:4326">` elements
   - Should have `<ows:LowerCorner>` and `<ows:UpperCorner>` child elements

3. **Test in MapStore:**
   - Add WFS service: `http://localhost:8001/wfs`
   - Should not throw JavaScript errors
   - Should display FeatureCollections properly

## Related Issues

This fix addresses:
- MapStore JavaScript errors when parsing WFS capabilities
- Missing bounding box information in WFS responses
- Incompatibility between WFS standard and MapStore expectations

## Future Improvements

1. **Dynamic Bounding Box Calculation:**
   - Calculate actual bounding boxes from FeatureCollection geometries
   - Support multiple coordinate reference systems

2. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Better fallback mechanisms for missing data
   - More detailed error logging

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Cache bounding box calculations
   - Optimize XML generation
